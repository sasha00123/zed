# SashaEdit distribution

Unofficial personal build of Zed; not affiliated with its upstream developer.

## Branches and feature PRs

- `main` is an exact, fast-forward-only mirror of `zed-industries/zed/main`.
- `feature/*` contains one independent change. Start from a suitable upstream commit, open a PR to `personal/main`, and merge with a merge commit to preserve feature history.
- `personal/main` contains reviewed features and these distribution files. Set it as the GitHub default branch **after merging this PR** so scheduled and manual workflows are discoverable. Never merge distribution code into `main`.
- Upstream sync advances `main` only if it is an ancestor of upstream; divergence fails without force-pushing. Integration is an explicit `main` → `personal/main` PR. A sync generated with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger another workflow; run Personal CI manually on the PR merge ref before merging (see below).
- Protect `personal/main` against deletion and force pushes; require Personal CI / Validate and both macOS build jobs. Protect `main` against deletion/force pushes but permit the sync bot's fast-forward updates. Avoid requiring distribution checks on `main`.

## Build and release

Personal CI builds PR merge commits and every push to `personal/main`, using ordinary hosted macOS Apple Silicon and Intel runners. PR jobs have read-only tokens and no signing secrets. Artifacts expire after 14 days.

Run `Personal CI` with ref `personal/main` and `source_ref=refs/pull/NUMBER/merge` to validate a bot-created upstream PR. Its artifact is a test build only. Resolve conflicts on a separate integration branch before testing.

Run `Personal Release` on `personal/main` with a numeric `version` such as `2026.9.19`. A version is immutable: reruns refuse existing tags/releases. Both architectures must build successfully before a draft GitHub Release is created. It contains ZIP apps, source archive at the exact built commit, Cargo.lock, source/rebuild instructions, license notices, checksums and a Homebrew manifest. Review the draft and launch the app before publishing it. Never publish a draft whose build or source bundle is incomplete.

The release source archive includes the exact Git tree and recursively initialized submodules. Rust registry and Git dependency sources are vendored into `vendor/`; use `cargo --config distribution/vendor-config.toml` when rebuilding from the archive. Non-Cargo build-time downloads and toolchains may still require the network. Preserve all corresponding sources for as long as distributing binaries.

After publication the separate `sasha00123/homebrew-tap` workflow discovers releases and opens a cask update PR. It uses its own repository token, so no cross-repository PAT is needed. Once the cask PR is merged:

```sh
brew install --cask sasha00123/tap/sasha-edit
brew upgrade --cask sasha-edit
```

The first cask appears only after a real published release; no placeholder versions or hashes are shipped. For local builds on a Mac with full Xcode, Rust and Homebrew:

```sh
bash distribution/setup-macos.sh
bash distribution/build-macos.sh 2026.9.19
```

## Identity and updates

- App: `SashaEdit.app`
- Bundle ID: `io.sasha00123.SashaEdit`
- URL scheme: `sasha-edit`
- Separate user data; no automatic migration or deletion of official-app settings.
- Unique geometric icon, generated from source by `icon.swift`.
- Upstream self-updating is disabled at compile time/channel configuration; update with Homebrew or GitHub Releases.
- Cloud accounts and upstream-hosted features still depend on the upstream services and their terms. Custom URI schemes may require provider-specific OAuth registration; cloud login callbacks are not certified by this pipeline.

## Signing later

Current bundles use ad-hoc signatures, **not** a trusted Developer ID signature and **not** Apple notarization. Gatekeeper may block the initial launch. Follow macOS Privacy & Security → Open Anyway for a build you trust; this project never disables Gatekeeper or automatically removes quarantine.

`sign-macos.sh APP` is the optional later stage, after packaging/identity changes and before ZIP/checksums. On a protected release runner import your Developer ID Application certificate into a temporary keychain, set `DEVELOPER_ID`, and store notarytool credentials as `NOTARY_PROFILE`. The script signs nested Mach-O code and bundles, submits to Apple, staples the accepted ticket, and verifies. Use your own team/certificate, never upstream credentials. Add this only to a release job protected by an environment; never expose credentials to PR builds. Enable only after a successful full signed/notarized test release.

## License and branding review (2026-09-19)

Primary application license: GPL-3.0-or-later. Keep all original copyright/license files. Reusable components retain their own licenses (Zed includes Apache-2.0; WarpUI uses MIT). Every binary must remain associated with publicly accessible corresponding source including modifications and build scripts. License and source notices are embedded in the bundle.

Sources: [Zed software overview](https://zed.dev/software-overview), [Zed brand](https://zed.dev/brand), [Warp FAQ](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/master/FAQ.md), repository LICENSE files. The source licenses do not provide permission to imply upstream endorsement. The application name, ID, protocol, Dock icon and release labels use the personal identity; upstream names in attribution and feature documentation describe origin. This is not a trademark clearance or a promise of upstream cloud support.
